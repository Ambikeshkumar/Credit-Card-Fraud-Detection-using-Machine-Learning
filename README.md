This project aims to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. The dataset contains transaction details with numerical features obtained from Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The goal is to develop a robust classifier to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

Dataset - creditcard.csv

Steps in the Project :
1. Data Preprocessing
    (Handling missing and outlier values),
    (Normalization and scaling of numerical features)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    (Distribution of fraud and non-fraud transactions),
    (Feature correlation heatmaps),
    (Transaction amount analysis)
3. Machine Learning Models Used -
    Logistic Regression,
    k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),
    Support Vector Machine (SVM),
    Decision Tree
4. Model Evaluation Metrics-
    Accuracy,
    Precision,
    Recall,
    F1-score
5. Table for (Accuracy,Precision,Recall,F1-score) on models.
6. Data Visualization using Matplotlib
